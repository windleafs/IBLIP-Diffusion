# IBLIP-Diffusion
IBLIP-Diffusion (Improved BLIP-Diffusion), as its name suggests, is an enhanced version of the BLIP-Diffusion model, aiming to address the shortcomings of the original model, such as insufficient semantic consistency in multi-interaction scenarios between text and images and low model efficiency.
